# Collection of Machine Learning Models
This repository contains a collection of Machine learning models that I have constructed to solve a range of problems, including [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/jakekolliari).

## Kaggle - Titanic Disaster

### Motivation
I have included this popular machine learning challenge purely to demonstrate the approach I typically take to tackle simple machine learning problems. 

### Description
Using Titanic passenger data, I have constructed a classification model to determine what sorts of people were more likely to survive the disaster. This work involves the construction of a machine learning pipeline and testing of a variety of classification algorithms.The chosen model uses a gradient-boosted decision tree algorithm with tuned hyperparameters to predict whether a given passenger was likely to survive or not given their passenger information.

### Files
Steps taken to develop the machine learning model are found within [Kaggle - Titanic Disaster/ml_model.ipynb](https://github.com/jakeyk11/ml-models-collection/blob/main/Kaggle%20-%20Titanic%20Disaster/ml_model.ipynb)
